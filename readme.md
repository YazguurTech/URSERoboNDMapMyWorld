PGM Map Creator: Install Dependencies
sudo apt-get install libignition-math2-dev protobuf-compiler


apt-cache search libignition-math

For gazebo 11:
sudo apt-get install libignition-math4-dev   



If you are using ROS Noetic, the pgm_map_creator package may not be fully compatible as it was primarily developed for earlier versions of ROS.

However, there are alternative methods to create a PGM map in ROS Noetic. One option is to use the map_server package, which is a standard ROS package for handling map-related operations.

To create a PGM map using the map_server package, you can follow these steps:

    Install the map_server package:

    sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-map-server

    Generate a map using Gazebo or any other method you prefer. Make sure to save the map as an image file (e.g., PNG).

    Convert the image file to a PGM file using the convert command from the ImageMagick package:

    convert map_image.png map.pgm

    Create a YAML file that describes the map. The YAML file should include the resolution, origin, and image file path. Here is an example:

    image: /path/to/map.pgm
    resolution: 0.05
    origin: [-10.0, -10.0, 0.0]

    Launch the map_server node with the YAML file:

    rosrun map_server map_server map.yaml

    This will start the map_server node and load the map.

By following these steps, you should be able to create and load a PGM map in ROS Noetic using the map_server package.

However, it is very likely to come across further issues down the line as pgm_map_creator is not really compatible with ROS Noetic. you can create the map in the Udacity workspace and, once generated, continue working on your VM).

RTAB-Map Real Time Visualization

Real Time Visulization is an additional node for real time visualization of feature mapping, loop closures, and more.
Itâ€™s not recommended to use this tool while mapping in simulation due to the computing overhead. rtabmapviz is great to deploy on a real robot during live mapping to ensure that you are getting the necessary features to complete loop closures.


Mapping: Database Viewer 

Database Analysis

The rtabmap-databaseViewer is a great tool for exploring your database when you are done generating it. It is isolated from ROS and allows for complete analysis of your mapping session.

This is how you will check for loop closures, generate 3D maps for viewing, extract images, check feature mapping rich zones, and much more!
